POJO => Plain Old Java Object

JPA is an ORM => Object Relational Mapping. ORMs sometimes have leakings.

A JavaBean is still a POJO but introduces a strict set of rules around how we implement it:

        Access levels – our properties are private and we expose getters and setters
        Method names – our getters and setters follow the getX and setX convention (in the case of a boolean, isX can be used for a getter)
        Default Constructor – a no-argument constructor must be present so an instance can be created without providing arguments, for example during deserialization
        Serializable – implementing the Serializable interface allows us to store the state



Generate:
    - Empty Constructor
    - Constructor
    - Getters and Setters
    - Override equals and hashcode
    - Implement ToString Method
